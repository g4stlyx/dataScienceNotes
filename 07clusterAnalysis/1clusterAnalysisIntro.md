# cluster analysis

* multivarite statistical technique that groups observations on the basis some of their features or variables they are described by
* like grouping countries by the continents they are in

* final goal: maximizing the similarity of observations within a cluster and maximize the dissimilarity between clusters

## examples:

* market segmentation: like grouping people as "middle aged people spending a lot", "middle aged people spending a litle bit", "young people spending a lot" etc.  
* image segmentation: 

## classification vs clustering

* classification:
    * model(inputs) -> outputs -> correct values
    * predicting an output category, given input data
* clustering:
    * model(inputs) -> outputs -> ???
    * grouping data points together based on similarities among them and difference from others.

## math prequisities

* distance between two data points:         
    * sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) in 2D space
    * sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2) in 3D space
* centroid: center of mass: midpoint of the line of two points
