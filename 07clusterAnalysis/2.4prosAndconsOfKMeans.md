# Pros And Cons
### Pros

* simple to understand
* fast to cluster
* widely available 
* easy to implement
* always yields a result (not always an advantage)

### Cons

* we need to pick K (the elbow method solves this)
* sensitive to initialization (if you choose seed poorly, thats a big problem), (kmeans++ for choosing appropriate seeds)
* sensitive to outliers (solution is removing outliers)
* produces spherical solutions 
* standardization

# Standardization

* you shouldnt standardize when one variable is clearly more important the the others.
* its generally a good thing.
