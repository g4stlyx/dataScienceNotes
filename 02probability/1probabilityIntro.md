### The Basic Probability Formula
* a = event
    * P(a) = probability = preferred/all = preferred/sample space

* a = event 1, b = event 2
    * probability of these hapenening at the same time = P(a and b) = P(a) * P(b)

### Expected Values

* expected value: P(a) x trialCount
* expected value with different events together: P(a)*a + P(b)*b + P(c)*c    
    * [P(a)+P(b)+P(c) =1]

### Complement

* a^c = a's complement = everything a is not
* p(a) + p(a^c) = 1
