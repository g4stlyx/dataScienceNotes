# Distributions

`the possible values a variable can take and how frequently they occur`

* P(Y=y) or P(y) -> the probability function
    * Y -> the actual outcome of an event
    * y -> one of the possible outcomes

* some terms
    * mean = average value = μ(mu-mü-)
    * variance = how spread out the data is = σ^2 -sigma squared-
    * population data = all data
    * sample data = some data
        * sample mean = x̄-x bar-
        * sample variance = s^2
    * standard deviation = positive square root of variance = σ -sigma-
        * for samples its "s"

* Mean and Variance Formula
    * σ^2 = E(Y^2) - μ^2

# Types of Probability Distributions

* Discrete Distributions -> finite numbers of outcomes
    * Uniform Dist. -> when all outcomes are equally likely (like flipping a coin or rolling a die)
    * Bernoulli Dist. -> TWO possible outcomes like "true and false"
    * Binomial Dist. -> similar experiment several times in a row, each iteration has two possible outcomes
    * Poisson D. -> test out how unusual an event frequency is for given interval

* Continuous Dist. -> infinitely many outcomes
    * Normal D. -> often observed in nature
    * Student's-T D. -> a small sample approximation of a Normal D. = normal d. with a limited data or time
    * Chi-Squared D. -> asymmetric, only consists of non-negative values
        * mostly used in hypothesis testing
    * Exponential D. -> events that are rapidly changing early on
    * Logistic D. -> useful in forecast analysis
