# Sets and Events

* set: group of elements
* event: set of outcomes

* terms like null/empty set, union, intersection etc. etc.

* mutually exclusive sets dont touch, since they have no common elements

* dependent and independent events

### Conditional Probability

* P(A|B) = conditional probability, when the result of A affects the result of B
    * = P(A intersection B) / P(B)

    * if they are independent P(A|B) = P(A), bcz the result of A'd'nt affect B

    * P(A|B) != P(B|A)

### The Additive Rule

* P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B)

### The Multiplication Rule

* P(A|B) * P(B) = P(A intersection B)

### BAYES' Law / BAYES' Theorem

* P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
