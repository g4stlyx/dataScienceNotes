- collecting the data
    - once collected, must be cleaned and preprocessed
- exploring the data
    - using statistical methods to understand the data structure, content, and relationship between variables
- modelling the data
    - select and apply various ML algorithms to identify patters or make predictions
    - e.g regression analysis, or turning to neural networks and deep learning for more complex data.
- interpreting the data
    - interpreting the outcomes of our data analysis and translating them into actionable insights.
