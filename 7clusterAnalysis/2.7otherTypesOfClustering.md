# Other Types of Clustering

* flat
    * k-means

* hierarchical
    * animal -> fish, mammals, birds... -> birds -> flying and flightless etc etc.
    * so it goes like this
    * types:
        * agglomerative (bottom-up)
            * easier to solve mathematically
        * divisive (top-down)
            * divisive can simulate k-means with 1,2,3,..,K clusters

* dendrograms
    * can be shown using scipy or seaborn
* heatmaps
