# Descriptive Statistics

## Types of Data

- categorical: represents categories or groups. like male/female, yes/no, car brands etc.
- numerical
  - discrete data: number of objects; grades etc.
  - continuous data: represented by intervals. height, area, distance, time, weight etc.

## Levels of Measurement

- qualitative:

  - nominal: categories -> brand of cars, seasons etc.
  - ordinal: no numbers but you can order this type of data. like "bad, neutral, good"

- quantitative:
  - interval: temperature (0C and 0F are not true zeros)
  - ratio: has a true 0. number of objects, time, distance

## Categorical Variables - Visualization Techniques

- frequency distribution tables: table of "Brand Name - Selling Frequency" 2 columns
- bar charts, pie charts, pareto diagrams

## Numerical Variables - Frequency Distribution Table

- table of 2 columns: interval, frequency:
<table> 
<thead>
<th> interval</th>
<th> frequency</th>
<th> relative frequency</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<td> 11-20</td>
<td> 5</td>
<td> 5/9 but in terms of %</td>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<td> 21-30</td>
<td> 4</td>
<td> 4/9 but in terms of %</td>
</tbody>
</table>

## Histogram

* horizantal axis is frequency, every vertical bar is a category

## Cross Tables and Scatter Plots

* used for representing more than 1 variables
    * for categorical data, cross tables are mostly used
    * for numerical data, 

## Mean, Median, and Mode

* mean: simple average, μ or x̄
* median: middle number on the ordered data set
* mode: value that occurs most often

## Skewness

`indicates whether the data is concentrated on one side`

* positive/right skew: outliers are to the right, highest point on left
    * mean > median
* zero/no skew: symmetrical
    * mean = median = mode
* negative/left skew: outliers are to the left, highest point on right
    * mean < median

## Variance

`measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean`

* population variance = σ^2
* sample variance = s^2

## Standard Deviation

* most common measure of variability:
    * for population = σ
    * for sample = s

## Coefficient of Variation (CV)

* used for comparing TWO OR MORE DATASETS : c_v =
    * for population = σ / μ
    * for sample = s / x̄

## Covariance 

`gives a sense of direction`

* cov(x,y) = cov(y,x)
* contrary to variance, covariance can be negative.

## Correlation Coefficient

* correlation of x and y = correlation of y and x
* it must be always between 1 and -1
* cov(x,y) / stdev(x) * stdev(y)
    * correlation of 0 = they have nothing in common
    * negative correlation = one man's trash is another man's treasure
