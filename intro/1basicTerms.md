# DATA SCIENCE AND AI STUFF

* The course to be followed: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/

* Flashcards for limitless amount of terms of data science: https://365datascience.com/flashcards/intro-to-data-science-flashcards/review/?utm_medium=udemy&utm_source=course&utm_campaign=flashcards

## Analysis vs Analytics

* Analysis is about the PAST, meaning to explain how and why things happen <br>
* Analytics is about the FUTURE, meaning to explore potential future events. Uses analysis. Has two types:<br>
    * Qualitative Analytics: intuition + analysis = planing your next move CONSIDERING THE PAST
    * Quantitative Analytics: formulas + algorithms = about math and statistics

## Bussiness Analytics, Data Analytics, Data Science

* Buss. Analytics: ps of transforming data into insights to improve buss. decisions.
* Data Analytics: same as above but not only about the buss.
* Data Science: the study of data to extract meaningful insights.

## Bussiness Intelligence, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence

* Buss. Intellegence (BI): ps of analysing and reporting historical (past) buss. data.
* Machine Learning (ML): a subfield of AI, the ability of machines to PREDICT OUTCOMES WITHOUT being EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED 
    * = coding algorithms that let machines use data and make predictions, analyse patterns, and give recommendations

* Artificial Intelligence (AI): simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers

## Traditional Data vs Big Data

* traditional data: structured, can be managed from 1 computer
* big data: extremely large, can be structured, semi-structured, unstructured. 3V's of Big Data:
    * Volume: typically, distrubuted between many computers.
    * Variety: not just strings or numbers, also images, audio files etc.
    * Velocity: way faster

## Traditional Methods vs ML
### Traditional Methods
* still perfectly applicable today. perfect for forecasting future performance with great accuracy
* prime examples: regression analysis, cluseter analysis, factor analysis

### Machine Learning
* = math + significant amount of computer power + ai
* = predict outcomes from data without being explicitly programmed to
