# Popular Data Science Techniques

some terms

* raw data: cannot be analysed straight away
* raw facts: untouched data you have accumulated and stored
* primary data: data collection

process in sum = raw data => processing => information

## Techniques for Working with Traditional Data

* data pre-processing: e.g. someone write "USA" as their name, removing/marking it is manually is data pre-processing

    * class labeling (categorical vs numerical): e.g. you mark the "cities" in a category so they cannot put "Sefa" there.

    * data cleansing: removing "Nwe York" and putting "New York" instead

    * dealing with missing values: when they skip a field like "age". Should you put there the average of the data or should you skip the entire field? handling that.

* case specific

    * balancing: e.g. there should be same amount of women as there is man, so the case would be gender-independent.

    * shuffling: randomizing the data to prevent unwanted patterns and misleading results.

## Techniques for Working with Big Data

* data pre-processing:
    * class labeling: number, text, images, video data, audio data etc.
    * data cleansing:
    * dealing with missing values

* case specific
    * text data mining: the ps of deriving valuable, unstructured data from a text
    * data masking: analysing the info. without compromising private details, securing the confidential info
