# Inferential Statistics

* the term "distribution", and subjects "Normal Distribution", "Std Normal Dist." are repeated.

## Central Limit Theorem

* sampling distribution of the mean: a distribution and its graphic consisting of the means of samples. since samples give different means, they are not trustable alone.
    * when you take the mean of the sampling dist. of the mean, it must be very close to the POPULATION MEAN.

* no matter the underlying dist., the sampling dist. approximates a Normal.

## Standard Error

= `the standard deviation of the distribution formed by the sample means`  <br>
= `standard deviation of the sampling dist.`

* important and widely used for all statistical tests
* decreases when sample size increases

## Estimators and Estimates

* estimator = `approximation depending solely on sample information`
    * must be efficient and un-biased
* estimate = `specific value found`
    * confidence interval estimate = interval
        * more reliable, gives more information
        * confidence level = a number like 95% or 99%
        * [point estimate - reliability factor * std err, point est. + rel. fac. * std err]
    * point estimate = single number, exactly middle of the interval estimate
